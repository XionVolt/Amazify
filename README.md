# Amazify
Amazify is a modern e-commerce interface inspired by Amazon, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Created as a project to enhance my JavaScript skills, it includes unique features like smooth add-to-cart transitions, intuitive navigation, and custom UI elements. Ideal for learning and exploring innovative web development.
